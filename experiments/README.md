# Experiments

This directory collects the different experiments performed on different research works and related notes.
They may be incomplete, since they are experiments done during the work and mostly not final.

A few examples of experiments with preliminary results can be found at the following folders:

- [Forecast of Lorenz signal with ESN](./07-ESN-STDP/README.md)
- [LSTM Anomaly Detector](./11-LSTM/README.md)
- [Topological Analysis of SNN](./14-LSM-rope-analysis/README.md)
