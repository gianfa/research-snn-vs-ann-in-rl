# PyTorch-ESN

PyTorch-ESN is a PyTorch module, written in Python, implementing Echo State Networks with leaky-integrated units. ESN's implementation with more than one layer is based on [DeepESN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04323). The readout is trainable by ridge regression or by PyTorch's optimizers.

Its development started under my master thesis titled ["An Empirical Comparison of Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gyt48dcktht7qur/document.pdf?dl=0), which was supervised by Prof. Alessio Micheli and Dr. Claudio Gallicchio at the University of Pisa.

## Prerequisites

* PyTorch

## Basic Usage

### Offline training (ridge regression)

#### SVD
Mini-batch mode is not allowed with this method.

```python
from torchesn.nn import ESN
from torchesn.utils import prepare_target

# prepare target matrix for offline training
flat_target = prepare_target(target, seq_lengths, washout)

model = ESN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)

# train
model(input, washout, hidden, flat_target)

# inference
output, hidden = model(input, washout, hidden)
```

#### Cholesky or inverse
```python
from torchesn.nn import ESN
from torchesn.utils import prepare_target

# prepare target matrix for offline training
flat_target = prepare_target(target, seq_lengths, washout)

model = ESN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, readout_training='cholesky')

# accumulate matrices for ridge regression
for batch in batch_iter:
    model(batch, washout[batch], hidden, flat_target)

# train
model.fit()

# inference
output, hidden = model(input, washout, hidden)
```

#### Classification tasks
For classification, just use one of the previous methods and pass 'mean' or
'last' to ```output_steps``` argument.

```python
model = ESN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, output_steps='mean')
```

Echo State Networks" by Mantas Lukoševičius.

### Online training (PyTorch optimizer)

Same as PyTorch.
