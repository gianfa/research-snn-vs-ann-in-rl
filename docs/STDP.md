# STDP Framework


```
STDP (Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity) is a learning rule that modifies the strength of the connections between neurons based on the relative timing of their spikes. The code above implements a simplified version of STDP, which assumes that a group of neurons is indexed by a unique integer.

The stdp_step
function takes as input:
* the weights matrix,
* connections matrix,
* and raster plot.
The weights matrix contains the current weights of the connections between neurons, the connections matrix contains information about which neurons are connected to each other, and the raster plot contains information about the spikes of each neuron over time.

The function first computes the time differences between the spikes of pre- and post-synaptic neurons, and then computes the weight changes based on these time differences using a lookup table generated by the 
stdp_generate_dw_lookup
 function. The weight changes are then applied to the weights matrix.

The 
stdp_generate_dw_lookup
 function generates a lookup table for the weight changes based on the STDP weight change formula. The formula takes as input the time difference between the pre- and post-synaptic spikes and some parameters (A_plus, A_minus, tau_plus, tau_minus) that determine the shape of the weight change curve. The lookup table is generated by computing the weight changes for a range of time differences and storing them in a dictionary.

Overall, the 
stdp_step
 function implements a simplified version of STDP that updates the weights of the connections between neurons based on the relative timing of their spikes.
