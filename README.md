## Structure

- *experimentkit/* is a convenience library that collects useful functions for creating research experiments.
- *experiments/* collects experiments made during the work.
- *stdp/* is a library that implements classes and functions related to the application of a simplified STDP algorithm, based on snnTorch.
- *tests/* contains test functions for the libraries in this projects.
